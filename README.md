## A Website The Features Myself

This application contains links to all of the most recent software engineering projects that I've been working on to improve as a software engineer. In addition, it contains an About section, a Contact section, a list of relevant software engineering skills that I possess, and link to all of my socials. This responsive website also features a theme changer so that the user can choose how to view the website on their own personal device.

## Purpose of this Project

This website represents a lot of what I've learned while studying to become a software engineer. I wanted to create something looks good while being fundamentally different from other websites.

### Thank you for viewing my Web Portfolio!
