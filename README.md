## A Website The Features Myself

This application contains links to all of the most recent software engineering projects that I've been working on to improve as an engineer. In addition, it contains an About section, a Contact section, a list of relevant sofware eningeering skills that I possess, and link to all of my socials. This resposive website also feartues a theme changer so that the user can choose how to view the website on their own personal device.


## Purpose of this Project 

This website represents a lot of what I've learn while studying to become a software engineer. I wanted to create something looks good while being fundamentally different from other websites. 

### Thank you for viewing my Web Portfolio!
