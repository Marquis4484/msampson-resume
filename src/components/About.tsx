            I’m always willing to work hard for what I desire. Whether its
            working on a personal project or problem solving task for others,
            I’ll put in nothing but my best work. I feel as though what allows
            me to work so hard is my strong sense of empathy. Undesrtand how
            people are and a personal level is the key to finding success within
            a team.
